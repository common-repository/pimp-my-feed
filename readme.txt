Adds Text and/or HTML-Code before and after posts in your Feed. For example a copyright notice or a legal disclaimer.

== Description ==

With this plugin you can add simple text or HTML *before* and *after* the posts in your feed. This might be used for a copyright notice, a legal disclaimer, a digital fingerprint, ads or any other text you might like there.

The text to display can easily be changed in the menu, this way it is no problem to change it periodically when being used to display ads or stuff like that.

You could also use the before section to write a disclaimer to discourage automated content theft.

== Installation ==

Pretty simple:

1. Unpack the `pimp-my-feed` archive you obviously downloaded
1. Upload the `pimp-my-feed` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the Pimp my Feed menu and *customize* the text you want to display
